## The Problem 
Describe the problem that your app will address. This does not need to be a novel idea or product, but your app should not directly recreate an existing product. If you are basing the app on an existing product, there should be some edge to your design or feature that solves a problem with that existing product.   
Everyday, women, childred, people of color and members of the lgbtq community endure various forms of street harassment. Currently there are no laws protecting the right to be at peace in public, nor is there any data on how frequently this happens. Shamer's aim is mulit-pronged: First, to create a sense of community among victims of public harassment. Second, created a databse that users cacn contribute to to share their experience. Third, to hold perpetrators accountable for their actions by bringing to light when and where these instances are taking place. And finally, to present aggregate data to relevant organizations, allies and lawmakes so that we make make real change to the quality of life of many.

In this section, please frame the issue with supporting statistics about the need (market size, competitors, use cases). You should fully think through your user - who is your user? Why do they need this app? How are they using it?   
The current data on public harassment is limited, but they all point to a desperate need for change. 
  - A 2013 (http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/resources/statistics/) study of 93,000 LGBQT individuals in the European Union found that HALF avoided public spaces sometimes because of street harassment and most reported high levels of fear.
  - Studies tracking trans harassment and violence are even more disturbing, starting as early as the K-12 environment from peers and teachers. In a survey by The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force(http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf),  53% of respondents reported being verbally harassed or disrespected in a
place of public accommodation and 8% reported having been physically assaulted.
  - We were unable to cite statistics regarding the harassment/stalking of children, but have reason to beleive there is a connection between such behavior and child abuductions/molestation/assault. Addtionally, child harassment can extend to bullying. One in four kids in the US have been bullied, which can lead to deeper developmental issues (decreased confidence, acting out, increased risk of suiced,etc).

## The Solution 
Please provide a detailed description of the app here. Map out how the app solves the problem described in section I. You should also include:
  *  Baseline features you plan to implement by Demo 1 (what + why).
    -map population of recorded instances
    -user log in
    -view self-reported instances + other users'
  *  Bonus features you plan to implement if baseline features are completed in time (what + why).
    -location services: alerts when entering high-frequency areas
    -graph data
    -sorting data on the map by date, shame type, time of occurrence, etc.
  *  A wireframe of the app. 

## Execution
Please describe how you will build this app. Include: 
  *  A detailed timeline for building the product, broken out by weekly sprints. Implement the training from the [Project Management workshop](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-3/blob/master/lessons/16_ProjectManagement.md) to plan your sprints and outline which features you want to build out over the next 4 weeks. Think about the user stories you would frame your sprints around. *Projects should be planned to complete the build by Demo 1 on September 1, 2015.*  
  -Week 1: Log-in sequence, creation of new users, crude saving of data to parse database, working framework, map pin drop
  -Week 2: Save user profile data, UX for reprorting shames, fetching parse data to populate map, filter feature(?), graph data
  -Week 3: Make it pretty, debugging, location alerts, demo prep
  
  *  A breakdown of team member responsibilities. Team members should take ownership over a specific feature or aspect of the app.   

-Anthony: 
*Sending an alert about dangerous ares based on user's location
*Show info based on tap&hold vs double tap
*Map flow (pin drop sequence and map info management)
